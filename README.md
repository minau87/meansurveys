# MEANSurveys
MEANSurveys is a project developed as part of an assignment at HSNR University of Applied Science.

# What it does
The task at hand was to create a RESTful backend service with a (MongoDB-) database, aswell as 
a client to create simple surveys.

As an admin you're supposed to have the ability to create surveys, that in turn are answered by the users of
the application.

With respect to our assignment, there are two scenarios we have to consider:
1. The ability to create a survey as a set of questions with corresponding answer possibilities.
2. The ability to create a survey as described in 1. that can only be answered for a limited period of time.

# How does it work
The app is powered by a RESTful backend based on NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.
For the frontend we're using Angular, thus completing the MEAN stack which we 
chose as our technology stack for this assignment.

For visualizing the results we're using Charts.js. Depending on how much progress is made
in the limited amount of time we have, real-time updates for displaying the results are 
an option we consider.
